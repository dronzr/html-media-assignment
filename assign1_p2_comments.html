comments provides notes to help developers to understand the code and document their HTML code better.
comments are used to write some which we dont want to execute in the program but still want to write in our program.
to write or use comments in our HTML, we use <!----> or to comment something quickly we use the shortcut key ctrl+/ and in mac we use cursor+ctrl+/.
example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>dronzr</h1>
<!-- dronzr is my name written in the h1 tag and i commented it.     -->
</body>
</html>
